# macOS-Tiny-Assistant
A small but powerful macOS Unix App. It can meet most of your usual needs.
# How to use
Just use the terminal to open it, and you can use it freely.
# Note
1. This tool is only applicable to macOS.
2. All the functions in it are in simplified Chinese (if you are overseas, you need to translate them).
3. The language inside is very clear, so novices can start. It is worth noting that sometimes the password will not be displayed when you enter it, and you need to type it by yourself.
